"Gilles DeLulz is a spambot that listens to top trending hashtags via the Twitter API and employs the known 'black hat' marketing technique. It extracts the top trending hashtag every 30 minutes and composes a tweet which ends with that tag. The tweet content is pooled from mashup of the inflental french philosopher's (Gilles Deleuze) texts that somehow reflect on capitalism, namely 'Postscript on Societies of Control', chosen chapters from 'Thousand Plateaus' (Capitalism and Schizophrenia), and an interview with Deleuze titled 'Capitalism, A Very Special Delirium'. These texts were mashed together and formatted in a way that sentences fit into a tweet, limiting textual input to max. 140 characters."

<b>Files contain bot code and text formatting and analysis code needed to prepare textual input data for tweeting.</b>
