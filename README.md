"Gilles DeLulz, sourcing its name from the trope of the internet trolling culture ("She did it for the lulz."), is a spambot that listens to top trending hashtags via Twitter API and employs the established 'black hat' marketing technique: it extracts the top trending hashtag in a defined time interval and composes a tweet which contains that tag. The tweet content itself is pooled from a mashup of texts of the influential 20th century french philosopher Gilles Deleuze, that somehow reflect on capitalism, namely 'Postscript on Societies of Control', chosen chapters from 'Thousand Plateaus' (Capitalism and Schizophrenia), and an interview with Deleuze titled 'Capitalism, A Very Special Delirium'. These texts were mashed together and computationally formatted in a way that sentences fit into a tweet, limiting textual input to max. 140 characters."

<b>Files contain bot code and text formatting and analysis code needed to prepare textual input data for tweeting.</b>
