"Gilles DeLulz is a bot that listens to top trending hashtags through Twitter API and employs the known 'black hat' Twitter marketing technique. It extracts the top trending hashtag every 60 minutes and composes a tweet that starts with that tag. The tweet content is pooled from mashup of the inflental french philosopher's texts that somehow refer to capitalism, namely 'Postscript on Societies of Control', chosen chapters from 'Thousand Plateaus' (Capitalism and Schizophrenia), and an interview with Deleuze titled 'Capitalism, A Very Special Delirium'. These texts were mashed together and formatted in a way that sentences fit into a tweet, limiting character lenghts to max. 140 characters."

Twitter spambot bringing snippets of Deleuze's philosophy to top trending streams. 

Files contain bot code and text formatting and analysis code needed to prepare textual input data for tweeting.
